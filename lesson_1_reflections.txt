How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It reduced the number of lines I had to look through, making it easier to locate the error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It would allow me to revert any major mistakes and more easily locate any errors.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
The cons include relying on the user to choose a proper time to create a commit and relying on the user to remember to make that commit.  The pros include having fewer versions to sort through and having more logical commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Some version control systems are geared towards projects that involve multiple interrelated files, like coding projects, while others are more geared towards projects that involve singular mostly-unrelated files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log showed me all of the commits in that repository and git diff showed the differences between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because, with version control, you can always revert to an earlier version that isn't broken and/or compare changes to find the bug.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use Git to upload my projects to GitHub.
